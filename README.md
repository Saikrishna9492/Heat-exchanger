CHT analysis on a flow through a counter-flow heat exchanger pipe


Conjugate heat transfer is a type of heat transfer analysis between solids and fluid(s). In solids, conduction often dominates whereas in fluids, convection usually dominates. Conjugate heat transfer is observed in many situations. For example, heat sinks are optimized to combine heat transfer by conduction in the heat sink with the convection in the surrounding fluid.

A counter-flow heat exchanger is one in which the direction of the flow of one of the working fluids is opposite to the direction to the flow of the other fluid. 
In a parallel flow exchanger, both fluids in the heat exchanger flow in the same direction.

Counter flow heat exchangers are inherently more efficient than parallel flow heat exchangers because they create a more uniform temperature difference between the fluids, over the entire length of the fluid path.

Due to storage concern I am uploading the results and animations and also the entire setup. You can directly run the set up to get the resluts .
